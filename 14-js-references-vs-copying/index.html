    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age1 = 100;
    let age2 = age1;
    //console.log(age1, age2);

    age1 = 200;
    //console.log(age1, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    //console.log(players, team); // same same

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = "Lux";
    //console.log(players); // will have "Lux" instead of "Poppy"

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy.
    // They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // will return a copy entire Array
    team2[3] = "Lux";
    //console.log(players, team2); // now they will not be the same

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // or use Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed!
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: "Ginger",
      age: 7,
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.age = 99; // now person.age will be 99 instead of 7
    //console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });

    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person}; // but not yet

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: "Edward",

    }

    // now if we want to make a copy of edward...
    const kitten = Object.assign({}, edward);
    kitten.name = "Ebony";
    console.log(edward, kitten); // works as expects, but

    kitten.social.twitter = "@ebony";
